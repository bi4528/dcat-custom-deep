As a rule, the right lung is slightly larger than the left and is divided into three lobes (an upper, a middle, and a lower or basal), while the left has two lobes (an upper and a lower or basal). Each lung is irregularly conical in shape, presenting a blunt upper extremity (the apex), a concave base following the curve of the diaphragm, an outer convex surface (costal surface), an inner or mediastinal surface (mediastinal surface), a thin and sharp anterior border, and a thick and rounded posterior border."

Part of: CD8_Plus_T-Lymphocyte. Defined as: Immunized T-lymphocytes which can directly destroy appropriate target cells. These cytotoxic lymphocytes may be generated in vitro in mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC), in vivo during a graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction, or after immunization with an allograft, tumor cell or virally transformed or chemically modified target cell. These cells are distinct from natural killer cells and from killer cells mediating antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity."

Part of: Hair_Cell, NCI_C33223. Defined as: A cell situated on one of three of the most outer layers of the basilar membrane of the cochlea. Each cell has multiple, sensitive strands called stereocilia. In the resting state the stereocilia are leaning on each other in a conical bundle and are embedded in the tectorial membrane. When the cochlea moves in response to sound, a slight shearing force occurs between the basilar and tectorial membranes, the stereocilia bend and send electrical impulses to the brain via the eighth cranial nerve."
